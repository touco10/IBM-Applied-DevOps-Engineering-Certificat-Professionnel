Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:  

- It is the product owner's responsibility to maintain a groomed backlog 

- Backlog refinement is used to order the product backlog and make stories sprint ready 

- You start refinement by triaging new issues 

- Large stories should be broken down until they are small enough to fit in a sprint 

- The goal of backlog refinement is to get the backlog ready for the sprint planning meeting 

- It is the product owner's responsibility to present the sprint goal 

- It is the development teamâ€™s responsibility to create a sprint plan 

- A sprint plan is created by moving stories from the product backlog into the sprint backlog until the team's velocity is reached
