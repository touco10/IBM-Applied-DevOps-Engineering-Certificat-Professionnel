Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:  

- A user story documents a person requesting a function to achieve a goal.

- Using a template helps ensure that stories are complete. 

- Defining "done" helps minimize misunderstandings. 

- Use the INVEST acronym to remember the qualities of a good user story: independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, and testable. 

- Epics can be used to capture big ideas. 

- Story points are a metric used to estimate the difficulty of implementing a given user story.

- Story points are relative, like T-Shirt sizes. 

- You must agree on what "average" means. 

- You should never equate story points with wall-clock time. 

- A product backlog is a ranked list of all unimplemented stories. 

- Stories high in the ranking should have more detail than those that are lower. 

- Create stories using the "As a", "I need", "So that" template to ensure everyone understands who it benefits and the business value it provides.
