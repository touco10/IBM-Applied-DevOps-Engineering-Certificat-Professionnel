# Summary and Highlights
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:  

  - High performing teams use metrics to continually improve 

  - It is important to be sure that the metrics you use are actionable 

  - You should take a baseline before trying to measure change.

  - It is important to give developers credit for unfinished stories 

  - Unfinished stories should be split into new stories to complete the work in the next sprint 

  - Each sprint milestone should be closed when completed to reflect the velocity of the sprint 

  - You should create a new milestone for the next sprint

  - The top 4 actionable metrics can be used to improve your teamâ€™s overall performance

\- Mean Lead Time (How long does it take from idea to production?) 

\- Release Frequency (How often can you deliver changes?) 

\- Change Failure Rate (How often do changes fail?) 

\- Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) (How quickly can you recover from failure?) 

- Anti-patterns to avoid when practicing Scrum include:

\- No real product owner

\-Teams are too large

\-Teams are not dedicated

\-Teams are too geographically distributed

\-Teams are siloed

\-Teams are not self-managing

- The Scrum health check provides guidelines for measuring a healthy scrum team
