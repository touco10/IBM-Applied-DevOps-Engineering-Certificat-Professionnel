# Summary and Highlights
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know: 

- A burndown chart shows the measurement of story points completed vs story points remaining for a sprint

- Burndown charts can be used to show progress and forecast the team's probability of achieving the sprint goal

- A sprint review is a demonstration of the features that have been implemented during the sprint

- Feedback from stakeholders is critical to help shape the future of the product

- The backlog is updated based on feedback

- A sprint retrospective is a time to reflect on how the sprint went

- The sprint retrospective is attended by the scrum master and the development team

- The team must feel comfortable to speak freely

- A sprint retrospective must result in changes to improve the next sprint

- Three questions are answered on what went right or wrong:

  - What went well? (keep doing)

  - What did not go well? (stop doing)

  - What should we change for the next sprint?
