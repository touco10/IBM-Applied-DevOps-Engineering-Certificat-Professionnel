# Summary and Highlights
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know: 

- Scrum is a methodology that follows the Agile philosophy

- The Scrum management framework:

  - Provides structure through defined roles, meetings, rules, and artifacts

  - Prescribes small, cross-functional, self-organizing teams

  - Uses fixed-length iterations called sprints

  - Produces a potentially shippable product increment with every iteration

- The product owner represents stakeholders, articulates the product vision, and decides priorities, requirements, and readiness to ship

- The scrum master coaches the team, promotes a cooperative environment, shields the team from interference, and unblocks impediments

- The scrum team is small, dedicated, co-located, cross-functional, and self-managing

- The scrum team negotiates commitments with the product owner — one sprint at a time

- The scrum team has autonomy regarding how to reach commitments

- Scrum produces a product backlog, a sprint backlog, and a completed — or done — increment

- The Scrum events are sprint planning, daily Scrum meetings, sprints, sprint reviews, and sprint retrospectives

If done well, Scrum can: 

- Increase employee productivity and happiness

- Improve product quality

- Reduce time to market

- Enhance stakeholder satisfaction
